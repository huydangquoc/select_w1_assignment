# Project - *Basic sorting algorithms*

**Basic sorting algorithms** 
One of the most fundamental problems in computer science is sorting a list.
We'll just be using Swift Playgrounds for this experiment, but it allows for some pretty easy TDD: check out those beautiful green checkmarks that update as you write code.

Time spent: **??** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Implementation Select Sort
- [x] Implementation Merge Sort
- [x] Implementation Quick Sort
- [x] Implementation one basic test to check an edge case
- [x] Implementation one test where merge sort outperforms quick sort.
- [x] Implementation one test where quick sort outperforms merge sort

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
